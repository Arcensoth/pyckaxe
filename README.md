You may be interested in Pyckaxe if you:

- Are a technical/creative player; or
- make adventure maps or minigames; or
- maintain large, complex data packs; or
- use command and/or data pack generators; or
- just want to over-engineer something.

The goal of Pyckaxe is to provide a flexible suite of development tools for technical Minecraft players:

- A complete hierarchy of **commands** and their subcommands, as well as frequently used **selectors** and **positions** to go along with them.
- A thorough collection of game object and **data tag (NBT)** representations, for things like **blocks**, **items**, and **entities**.
- Auto-completion, argument suggestion, and type validation for all representations.
- Utilities for building datapacks and resources via custom-written generators.
