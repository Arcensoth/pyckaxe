# pyckaxe
An expressive Minecraft utility library revolving around data manipulation and generation.

You maybe be interested in `pyckaxe` if:

- You are a technical/creative player.
- You make adventure maps or minigames.
- You use command/data generators.
- You write your own generators.
- You work on large/complex projects.
- You already know you're interested.

The goal of `pyckaxe` is to provide a flexible suite of development tools for technical Minecraft players:

- A complete hierarchy of **commands** and their subcommands, as well as frequently used **selectors** and **positions** to go along with them.
- A thorough collection of game object and **data tag (NBT)** representations, for things like **blocks**, **items**, and **entities**.
- Auto-completion, argument suggestion, and type validation for all representations.
- Utilities for building datapacks and resources via custom-written generators.
